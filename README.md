# About
____

This is my basic boilerplate for starting React projects. I setted up webpack with some basic functionality like sass loader, babel for React and dev-server for browser syncing.

# Scripts
____
First run **npm install** for intalling all node modules dependencies.
Now you are good to go. Run **npm start** to start webpack-dev-server and you are ready to develop.
